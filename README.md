Analyzer for data collected on vocal cord movement using DeepLabCut. 

Current version: Extremely disorganized. Haven't decided on overall structure yet

End Goal: Create a gui that allows doctors and researchers to input video. Program will pass everything through deeplabcut, analyze the dataset and return a labeled video that outputs full analysis of the cords.
