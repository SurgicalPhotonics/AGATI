# VCTrack
Analyzer for data collected on vocal cord movement using DeepLabCut. 

Current version: Early GUI Implemented

Current version only works for windows. Basic function will automatically edit deeplabcut config.yaml file, but more advanced changes will require user to directly edit config file. This will not interfere with program, and is encouraged. We recommend notepad++ to edit config file. If the user moves the dlc file directory within their file system, they must edit the displayed paths in the config file.
