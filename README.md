# AGATI

Analyzer for data collected on vocal cord movement using DeepLabCut. 

Current version: Full release for windows. See directions for installation under releases. 

Current version only works for windows. Basic function will automatically edit deeplabcut config.yaml file, but more advanced changes will require user to directly edit config file. This will not interfere with program, and is encouraged. We recommend notepad++ or visual studio code to edit config file.
